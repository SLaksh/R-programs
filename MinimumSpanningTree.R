#' Computes a minimum cost spanning tree
#'
#' Given a connected weighted undirected graph, \code{getMinimumSpanningTree}
#' computes a minimum cost spanning tree. This function provides methods to 
#' find a minimum cost spanning tree with the three most commonly used
#' algorithms: "Prim", "Kruskal" and "Boruvka".
#' 
#' @details Given a connected weighted undirected graph, a minimum spanning 
#' tree is a spanning tree such that the sum of the weights of the arcs is 
#' minimum. There may be several minimum spanning trees of the same weight in
#' a graph. Several algorithms were proposed to find a minimum spanning tree in 
#' a graph.
#' 
#' Prim's algorithm was developed in 1930 by the mathematician Vojtech 
#' Jarnik, independently proposed by the computer scientist Robert C. Prim
#' in 1957 and rediscovered by Edsger Dijkstra in 1959. This is a greedy
#' algorithm that can find a minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted
#' undirected graph by adding minimum cost arcs leaving visited nodes 
#' recursively.
#' 
#' Kruskal's algorithm was published for first time in 1956 by 
#' mathematician Joseph Kruskal. This is a greedy algorithm that finds a 
#' minimum cost spanning tree in a connected weighted undirected graph by
#' adding, without form cycles, the minimum weight arc of the graph in each
#' iteration.
#' 
#' Boruvka's algorithm was published for first time in 1926 by 
#' mathematician Otakar Boruvka. This algorithm go through a connected weighted 
#' undirected graph, reviewing each component and adding the minimum weight 
#' arcs without repeat it until one minimum spanning tree is complete.
#'
#' @param nodes vector containing the nodes of the graph, identified by a 
#' number that goes from \eqn{1} to the order of the graph.
#' @param arcs matrix with the list of arcs of the graph. Each row represents
#' one arc. The first two columns contain the two endpoints of each arc and the
#' third column contains their weights.
#' @param algorithm denotes the algorithm used to find a minimum spanning
#' tree: "Prim", "Kruskal" or "Boruvka".
#' @param check.graph logical value indicating if it is necesary to check the
#' graph. Is \code{FALSE} by default.
#' @param start.node number which indicates the first node in Prim's algorithm.
#' If none is specified node 1 is used by default.
#' @param show.data logical value indicating if the function displays the 
#' console output (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). The default is
#' \code{TRUE}.
#' @param show.graph logical value indicating if the function displays a 
#' graphical representation of the graph and its minimum spanning tree
#' (\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). The default is \code{TRUE}.
#'
#' @return \code{getMinimumSpanningTree} returns a list with:
#' tree.nodes vector containing the nodes of the minimum cost spanning tree.
#' tree.arcs matrix containing the list of arcs of the minimum cost spanning
#' tree.
#' weight value with the sum of weights of the arcs.
#' stages number of stages required.
#' stages.arcs stages in which each arc was added.
#' time time needed to find the minimum cost spanning tree.
#' This function also represents the graph and the minimum spanning tree and
#' prints to the console the results whit additional information (number of
#' stages, computational time, etc.).
